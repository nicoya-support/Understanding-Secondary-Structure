Additional Files You Need to Upload 📁
For this page to work properly on GitHub Pages, you'll need to add these missing files to your repository:
1. JSmol Library Files (REQUIRED)
You need to download and include the complete JSmol distribution:

Download from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmol/files/Jmol/
Extract and upload the entire jsmol folder containing:

JSmol.min.js (or the full version)
j2s/ directory (contains Java2Script compiled code)
php/ directory (for server-side features)
Other JSmol support files



2. CSS File (REQUIRED)

Create or upload: style.css
This file is referenced on line 6 but is missing

3. PDB Files (REQUIRED)
Your code references many PDB files that need to be in the same directory:

idealalpha.pdb
2trx.pdb, 1arb.pdb, 6ec0.pdb
1u4g.pdb, 1v54.pdb, 1qoy.pdb, 2cpp.pdb
1tvf.pdb, 5mbn.pdb, 1qte.pdb, 1rwz.pdb
1kss.pdb, 1gpb.pdb, 2qd1.pdb, 2beg.pdb
1ofs.pdb, 1ba7.pdb, 2yxf.pdb, 3cna.pdb
And many more (see the full list in moleculeProps)

4. Script Files (REQUIRED)

helicesScript.txt (referenced on line 1654)

5. Image Files

ramachandran.svg (referenced in ramachandran.js)
labels.svg (referenced in ramachandran.js)

6. Additional JavaScript Files
The following JS files are already provided but should be in the same directory:

builder.js
controls.js
moleculeLoaded.js
ramachandran.js
subviews.js

Configuration Tips 🔧

GitHub Pages Settings

Go to repository Settings → Pages
Set source to your main branch
Set folder to / (root) or /docs if you prefer


Path References

All paths in your HTML use relative references (./filename)
This is correct for GitHub Pages
Make sure all files are in the root or same directory


Testing Locally

Use a local web server (not just opening the file)
Try: python -m http.server 8000
Or use VS Code's Live Server extension



Common Issues ⚠️

404 errors: Missing PDB files or JSmol library
JavaScript errors: Missing JSmol.min.js or syntax errors
Blank page: Check browser console for errors
CORS issues: Ensure all files are served from the same domain

Quick Start 🚀

Upload the corrected index.html
Download JSmol from SourceForge
Upload all PDB files
Create a basic style.css if you don't have one
Commit and push to GitHub
